# Deep_Image_Prior

Image restoration is one of the most widely studied problems in computer vision. Currently, Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) achieves the state-of-the-art performance for different image restoration problems. In this project, we replicate the [Deep Image Prior] (https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/deep_image_prior) framework in Keras, which fits a generator network to a single degraded image instead of training a CNN on a large dataset of example images. In this project, we develop the proposed network which is a U-Net type decoder-encoder architecture with skip-connections and particularly focus on denoising and inpainting problems. Our main contribution in this work is validating the effectiveness of the network architecture proposed the authors. In our experiments, the images generated from denoising and inpainting tasks were competitively comparable with those in the paper, and the overfitting problem occurs repeatedly as iteration increases.
